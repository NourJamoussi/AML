# Algorithmic Machine Learning

This repository contains code and reports of Machine Learning and Deep Learning challenges on Kaggle. 

The challenges were organized by Institut Eurecom (Sophia Antipolis, FR) and they are:

<ul>
  <li><b>Weather prediction:</b> linear regression to infer the temperature of a specific place on the Earth.</li>
  <li><b>Anomaly sound prediction</b>: classification problem to determine if a machine's sound is either normal or anomalous.</li>
  <li><b>Sentiment analysis on tweets</b>: classification problem where the goal is to assess if a tweet feeling is positive, neutral or negative.</li>
</ul>

The challenges have been organized in 2022 Spring Semester and they lasted two weeks each. 

In each folder you can find the notebook with the implementation and the final report of a specific challenge.
